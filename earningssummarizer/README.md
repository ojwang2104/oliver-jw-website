# Earnings Summarizer (Organization Hub)

This folder is a lightweight organization layer. It does **not** contain the runtime code.
The Next.js app still expects `app/`, `components/`, and `lib/` at the repo root.

## Why this exists
- Keeps related files discoverable without breaking the app.
- Acts as a quick map of the feature.

## Where the code actually lives
See `FILES.md` for exact paths.
